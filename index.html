      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <article id="about">
        <p>Growing up in the digital age, I've spent most of my life glued to a computer screen. On days when I convince myself to get up, sign off Facebook and read a real book instead, I turn to my bookshelf which is cluttered with the latest titles on social media, digital communications, and graphic design. As a marketer in today's world, I'm always looking for interesting ways to deliver a message that will fascinate my audience.</p>
        <p>I'm driven by the challenge to create branded content that is irresistibly compelling. Through the power of creative storytelling, my ultimate goal is to engage others and inspire action.</p>
